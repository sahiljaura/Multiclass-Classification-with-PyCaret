# Multiclass Classification with PyCaret
## Overview
This project explores multiclass classification using PyCaret, a Python library for automated machine learning. The goal is to predict stress levels in individuals based on sleep-related data from the "Stress_Detection_In_And_Through_Sleep" dataset.

### Dataset
The dataset contains features related to sleep patterns and physiological signals, along with labels indicating stress levels. It aims to capture stress levels experienced by individuals during sleep.

### Approach
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training:** Utilize PyCaret to automate model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation across multiple machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compare the performance of different models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the best-performing model for stress level prediction in real-world scenarios.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyCaret
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
