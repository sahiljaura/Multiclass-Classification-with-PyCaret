# Multiclass Classification with PyCaret
## Overview
This project explores multiclass classification using PyCaret, a Python library for automated machine learning. The goal is to predict stress levels in individuals based on sleep-related data from the "Stress_Detection_In_And_Through_Sleep" dataset.

### Dataset
The dataset contains features related to sleep patterns and physiological signals, along with labels indicating stress levels. It aims to capture stress levels experienced by individuals during sleep.In this dataset human stress level in and through sleep is categorized into 5 different stress levels: (0- low/normal, 1 â€“ medium low, 2- medium, 3-medium high, 4 -high). A total of 630 observations were taken into account. The data has been gathered from Literature Review (No human subjects were considered).This dataset is generated by the member of IEEE.

The data set can be used for the tasks of classification and cluster analysis.

Attribute Information:

To construct the data, Eight different parameters or features of health were recorded:

1.Snoring range of the user(SR)

2.Respiration rate(RR)

3.Body temperature(T)

4.Limb movement rate(LM)

5.Blood oxygen levels(BO)

6.Eye movement(EM)

7.Number of hours of sleep(SR.1)

8.Heart rate(HR)

Dataset is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laavanya/human-stress-detection-in-and-through-sleep

### Approach
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training:** Utilize PyCaret to automate model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation across multiple machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compare the performance of different models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the best-performing model for stress level prediction in real-world scenarios.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyCaret
- Pandas
